/*
  The main difference between the Explicit declaration and the arrow function is the context. Arrow function doesn`t have a context.

  In the above exemple we pass both functions as my object atributes, doing this, the function takes the object`s context, but it doesn`t happen with the arrow function, so when we call the functions, just the first one prints values in the console.
